Pytam Cię mój drogi dlaczego tak nie mogę
Spakować się nad ranem wyruszyć w daleką drogę
Wyglądać przy tym cudnie niezależnie od pogody
Z włosami pięknymi i po wyjściu z zimnej wody

Pytam Cię gdzie podziała się ta kobieca siła
Z którą w obcasach Mount Everst bym zdobyła
Zastanawiasz się nad tymi pytaniami kilka dni
Aż piątego dnia nad ranem nagle odpowiadasz mi

Bo jesteś kluską po prostu kluską
Choć bardzo starasz się wyglądać na istotę ludzką
Tak naprawdę jesteś pierogiem
Najchętniej cały dzień leżałabyś odłogiem

Dlatego każdy wieczór kiedy słońce znika
Zawijasz się w koc i zamieniasz w naleśnika
Bo bycie kluską właśnie tak wygląda
Przynajmniej kluska z Ciebie jest porządna

La la la \n
Teraz już wiem dlaczego zamiast mięśni mam ciasto
A najlepszy makijaż dla mnie to masło
Wiem dlaczego moje nogi wyglądają jak serdelki
Gdy staram się włożyć jakieś zgrabne pantofelki

Gdy pod kołdrą zapadam w zimowy sen
Na moich ustach jeszcze widać dżem
Dlatego gdy znajomi zapraszają na przygodę
Bez wahania odpowiadam że nie mogę

Bo jestem kluską po prostu kluską
Choć bardzo staram się wyglądać na istotę ludzką
Tak naprawdę jestem pierogiem
Najchętniej cały dzień leżałabym odłogiem

Dlatego każdy wieczór kiedy słońce znika
Zawijam się w koc i zamieniam w naleśnika
Bo bycie kluską właśnie tak wygląda
Przynajmniej kluska ze mnie jest porządna

La la la
Kluska
Kluska
Aaa

She said, "Forget all the slow dancing
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom
You know you ain't even gotta ask me
Baby, we could take it to the bathroom"

She knows what I want
She always gives it to me
I'm fallin' in love
This is addictive, please
I'm sorry, girl
For the way you make me feel
You were my world
And you ruined everything

Tell me what it is you wanna know
Finish up the bottle then we'll go, babe
Waste a little money on some blow
She said, "Won't you have a little?"
I said, "No way"

I'm too phased, it's too late
But coming down is all I ever do, babe, yeah
And I'm so down if you're ready
I'm floating but I'm heavy
And I'll show you if you let me, girl

I don't know if you already know how
But girl, I got the feeling that you know now
You're buried in the pillow, yeah, you're so loud
But I'm about to show you, baby, slow down
Slow down, slow down
I'm about to show you, baby, slow down
Slow down, slow down
I'm about to show you, baby, slow down

Push a little further on the edge
Crawl a little further on the bed, babe
I'm burning up, yeah, all I see is red, ah

I said, "Okay"

Lavender Lamborghini, roll up in a blue bikini
Bitches on the beaches, lookin' super cute and freaky
All my friends are princesses, we keep it whipped and creamy
Ice cubes on our tongues because we like to keep it freezy
Lavender Lamborghini, get out on the right side
Chauffeur stayed at home because my girl wanted to ride
Lookin' luxe and tastin' plush, I'm feelin' so alive
Want to take it to the highway, come on, let's go for a drive, uh

Don't think about consequences 'cause they're never gonna stop me, what?

When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me
One-on-one but you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryna be cool
You look like a fool to me, tell me

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
You fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are ain't where it's at
You see, you're makin' me
Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know, you're not foolin'

Big doe eyes, amazin', she's everything I've been prayin'
My heart palpitations, she looks like the type to break it

Spell my name with her tongue, like uh-huh

I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, "Darlin', you look perfect tonight"

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight

No, no, no
Mm, no, no

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight

Take it
If she gives you her heart, don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have

She always has trouble falling asleep
And she likes to cuddle while under the sheets
She loves pop songs and dancing, and bad trash TV
There's still a few other things
She loves love notes and babies and likes giving gifts
Has a hard time accepting a good compliment
She loves hеr whole family and all of her friends
So if you'rе the one she lets in

Take it
If she gives you her heart, don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you, if you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole world might cave in
Stand side by side and you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you, if you love her like that

Kiss her with passion as much as you can
Run your hands through her hair whenever she's sad
And when she doesn't notice how pretty she is
Tell her over and over so she never forgets

Take it
If she gives you her heart, don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
